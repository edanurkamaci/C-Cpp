    Today we live an era where information is processed 
almost at the speed of light. Through computers, the 
techonological revolution is drastically changing the way we 
live and communicate with one another. Terms such as 
"the Internet, " which was unfamiliar just a few years ago, are 
very common today. With the help of computers you can send
letters to, and recieve letters from, loved ones within
seconds. You no longer need to send a résumé by mail to apply
for a job; in many cases you can simply submit your job 
application via the Internet. You can watch how stocks perform 
in real time, and instsantly buy and sell them. Students 
regularly "surf" the Internet and use computers to design 
their classroom projects. They also use powerful word
processing software to complete their term papers. Many 
people maintain and balance their checkbooks on computers.
